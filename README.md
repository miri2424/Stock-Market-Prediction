# Stock-Market-Prediction

This project involves predicting stock market trends using deep learning models built with Keras and visualizing the results on a local Streamlit web application. The application provides an interactive interface to display stock data and prediction graphs.****

Features
Data Loading: Load historical stock market data from CSV files or APIs.
Data Preprocessing: Normalize and prepare the data for the model.
Deep Learning Model: Use Keras to build and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for stock price prediction.
Interactive Visualization: Visualize stock data and predictions using Streamlit.
User-friendly Interface: Access the application on localhost via Streamlit for an intuitive experience.
